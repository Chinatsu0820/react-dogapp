# This is an APP to find a breed's picture which an user looks for.

# This project meets all of the following conditions:

1. Git & GitHub
The project should be on GitHub, with public access enabled for potential employers to be able to clone and check its code. And it should demonstrate appropriate usage of Git VCS, with a main branch, commits for individual page sections, and commit messages written appropriately.

2. Project Setup
The project files should demonstrate an appropriate structure and organization, including proper file and directory naming conventions. 

This includes having the index.html file in the root of my project directory.

3. README File
The project should have a README.md file at the root directory which potential employers can easily access and read on GitHub, and which clearly and concisely describes what the project is about (what I built and what I am showcasing with that project), as well as any other relevant information such as navigation/usage instruction and authors if applicable.

4. Semantic HTML5
My project should demonstrate proper use of HTML5 with semantic markup preferred over presentational, proper element/tag placement and structure, proper indentation, adequate use of tag attributes, etc.

5. CSS Styling Basics
My project should demonstrate good understanding and appropriate usage of CSS basics, including appropriate usage of external, internal, and inline CSS (with external CSS being prioritized), appropriate usage of type, class, and id selectors (including appropriate naming conventions), appropriate CSS declaration syntax (including indentation).

6. HTML Block Elements & CSS Box Model
My project should demonstrate understanding and appropriate usage of the HTML block, inline and block-inline elements, together with the CSS Box Model.

7. Responsive
My project should be fully responsive, adapting well to the four categories of screen sizes: Phone, Tablet, Desktop, and Wide Screen. 

8. ES6+ JavaScript
My project should demonstrate understanding and appropriate usage of ES6+ JavaScript, including appropriate usage of external, internal, and inline JS (with external JS being prioritized), and appropriate variable and function naming and calling.

9. Comments
All the projects should demonstrate understanding and appropriate usage of line commenting in all code files (HTML, CSS, and JS)

10. W3C HTML Validation & ARIA Accessibility Validation
The project should receive acceptable scores when presented to a W3C HTML validation, and to an Accessibility validation tool.

11. Single-Page Web App (SPA)
This project should be a dynamic Single-Page web Application (SPA) built with ES6+ JavaScript using the React.js framework.

12. Component-based UI with vanilla / native JS
The project should demonstrate understanding and appropriate usage of Component-based elements using only vanilla / native JavaScript (have some components that are created and handled with pure JS instead of React, but keep it simple).

13. Component-based UI with React.js
The project should demonstrate understanding and appropriate usage of Component-based elements via the React framework.

14. Props & Component Re-usability
The project should demonstrate understanding and appropriate usage of component properties (props) with the React framework. Props are a way of passing data from parent to child components. They are read-only and help to make my components reusable.

15. Component State with React
The project should demonstrate understanding and appropriate usage of Component States with the React framework. While props allow data to be passed into a component, the state is where any data that should change over time is stored. State is mutable, but it should not be modified directly. Instead, I use setState in class components or the useState hook in functional components.

16. React Hooks
The project should demonstrate understanding and appropriate usage of Hooks with the React framework. Hooks allow me to use state and other React features without writing a class. Examples include useState, useEffect, and useContext.

17. SPA Routing with React
The project should demonstrate understanding and appropriate usage of Routing with Single-Page Application built using the React framework. React doesn't come with built-in routing, but libraries like react-router allow me to add this functionality. With react-router, different components load and display depending on the route, but only a single HTML page (typically index.html) is ever loaded. This provides the smooth navigation experience characteristic of SPAs.

18. React Context API
The project should demonstrate understanding and appropriate usage of State Management with the modern React Context API.

19. Styled Components with CSS-in-JS
The project should demonstrate understanding and appropriate usage of CSS-in-JS to style the React components. Commonly used on React projects, this is a pattern where CSS is composed using JavaScript. Libraries like styled-components or Emotion are popular solutions. It allows for dynamic styling based on props or state.

20. API calls with Fetch API or Axios
The project should demonstrate understanding and appropriate usage of ES6+ JavaScript to make API calls to a server within a React project. The Fetch API is a modern way to make asynchronous HTTP requests in JavaScript. It returns promises and is generally easier to work with compared to the older XMLHttpRequest. Alternatively I can use Axios instead of Fetch API; Axios is a popular third-party library for making HTTP requests. It offers several advantages over the Fetch API, including automatic JSON data transformation, error handling, and request and response interception. Axios is often favored in the React community because of its flexibility and ease of use.

20. Jest and React Testing Library
The project should demonstrate understanding and appropriate usage of Jest and React Testing Library for test-driven development and advanced debugging. Jest is a JavaScript testing framework. It can test any JavaScript code, and it provides functionalities like mocking, assertions, and more. Meanwhile React Testing Library is a library specifically for testing React components. It encourages your applications to be more accessible and allows me to write tests that resemble how users interact with your app. It doesn't replace Jest but complements it. In fact, it's often used in conjunction with Jest.

# Getting Started with Create React App

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in your browser.

The page will reload when you make changes.\
You may also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.\
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.\
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

### `npm run eject`

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can't go back!**

If you aren't satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.

Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right into your project so you have full control over them. All of the commands except `eject` will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point you're on your own.

You don't have to ever use `eject`. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you shouldn't feel obligated to use this feature. However we understand that this tool wouldn't be useful if you couldn't customize it when you are ready for it.
